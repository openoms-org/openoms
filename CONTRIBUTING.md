# Contributing to OpenOMS

Thanks for your interest in OpenOMS!

## Current Status

We're in **Phase 0 (Validation)** — the codebase doesn't exist yet. We're validating the idea, collecting feedback, and preparing to build the MVP.

## How You Can Help Right Now

### 1. Join the waitlist
Sign up at [openoms.org](https://openoms.org) to be notified when the MVP is ready for testing.

### 2. Share your experience
Are you a Polish e-commerce seller? We want to hear about your pain points with order management. [Open an issue](https://github.com/openoms-org/openoms/issues) and tell us:
- What tools do you currently use?
- What's broken or frustrating?
- What would your ideal OMS look like?

### 3. Star the repo
It helps us gauge interest and motivates us to ship faster.

## When Code Contributions Open

Once the MVP codebase is in place, we'll publish:
- Development setup guide
- Code style and architecture docs
- "Good first issue" labels for newcomers
- PR review process

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful. We're building this for the community, and everyone is welcome regardless of experience level.
